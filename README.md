# People quality of life evolution data analysis

## Intro
This is a **student project** from the **Udacity Nanodegree "Data Analyst"**.
The goal of this project is to. 

## Dataset relevant info and features of interest:
Investigation of the Gapminder World dataset and analysis of the evolution of peopleâ€™s quality of life from the 90s to 2015 through the indicators of Human Development, Gross National Income per capita and female labor participation.

- **The Human Development Index (HDI)** indicator is an index used to rank countries by level of human development. It contains three dimensions: health level, educational level and living standard.
- **The Gross National Income (GNI)** per capita indicator is in US dollars and is converted using the World Bank Atlas method. Is the gross national income divided by mid-year population.
- The **Labour force participation rate** (%) for females aged 15-64 indicator is the percentage of female labour to total female population.
With these indicators, we will explore how HDI has evolved over time and whether there has been a decrease in human development in some countries. We will analyze if there is a correlation between the Human Development Index and the Gross National Income per capita. In this way, it will be possible to see if the national income is invested in health, education and other human development outcomes.
- As for the **GNI per capita**, we wonder how it differs between continents and countries belonging to the same continent. If there is a difference in income between countries on the same continent, is there also a difference in human development between them? Do the continents have great economic inequalities?
Finally, we want to know if there is a greater female workforce as a result of greater human development and if the female workforce is a global fact.

## Documents I received to explore the dataset:
- Dataset found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gapminder.org/data/&sa=D&ust=1532469042121000).

## Finding I got from my exploratory data analysis:
- The Human Development Index has grown over the years in all the continents.
- There is a positive correlation between HDI and Gross National Income (GNI) per
capita.
- No correlation between female workers and HDI.

## My analysis:
 -`project_how_peoples_quality_of_life_has_evolved_v2.ipynb`(and its html version) used to perform my analysis.
 - The rest are .csv files I have downloaded from the dataset and merge.
